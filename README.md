# Contact-Application

This repo Contact-Application details my solution to designing a application that displays contact information from a https link, which is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. 

The solution is developed through React along with Vite. Within this repo, the react project can be found by navigating to the contact-app folder. In here are all the necessary files required to run my application locally on your device. 

To see the written code, navigate to the src folder and in here you would see App.jsx, ContactCard.jsx, ContactList.jsx, index.css and main.jsx. The ones that are important are ContactList.jsx, index.css and ContactCard.jsx as that is where majority of the written code is located.
